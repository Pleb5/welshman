# What is Welshman?

Welshman is a production-grade nostr toolkit powering [Coracle](https://coracle.social) and [Flotilla](https://flotilla.social).

Built as independent, opt-in packages, it lets you choose exactly what you need - from basic utilities handling to a batteries-included application framework.

Need just a content parser? Grab @welshman/content. Building a complex client? Start with @welshman/app and add more packages as you grow.

Each module is battle-tested in production, and designed to work together.
